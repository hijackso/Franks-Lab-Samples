STFP_Graph, prefRatio, and p_Calc were written by me for data analysis of STFP data in the Franks Lab. p_Calc is used in STFP_Graph.

simple_mixed_anova, swtest, and sig_line are public functions on MATLAB FileExchange that I use in STFP_Graph. I added modifications to sig_line, as noted in the function's comments.
