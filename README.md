# MATLAB functions

I wrote all of these functions except sigline, simple_mixed_anova, and swtest. I got these three files from MATLAB FileExchange and use them in STFP_Graph.

STFP_Graph and p_Calc are part of what I wrote for data analysis of my STFP data in the Franks Lab. p_Calc is used in STFP_Graph.
