# MATLAB functions

I wrote all of these functions except simple_mixed_anova and swtest. sig_line was not written by me but I modified it. I got these three files from MATLAB FileExchange and use them in STFP_Graph.

STFP_Graph, prefRatio, and p_Calc are part of what I wrote for data analysis of my STFP data in the Franks Lab. p_Calc is used in STFP_Graph.
